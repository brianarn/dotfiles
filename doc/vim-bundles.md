# Vim bundles

I like to play with various bundles, but I've gotten a little crazy, so I'm trying to start documenting what I'm using and why, as well as things I used at one point and then decided to remove.

## Bundles I no longer use

### vim-rails

URL: https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails.git

Reason I no longer use: I'm not writing anything in Rails at all.

### vim-haml

URL: https://github.com/tpope/vim-haml.git

Reason I no longer use: I don't use haml, and honestly never really did.

### vim-pastie

URL: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pastie.git

Reason I no longer use: I never bothered to learn it and almost never use pastie. I'd be better off investigating a gist plugin anyways.

### vim-jade

URL: https://github.com/digitaltoad/vim-jade.git

Reason I no longer use: I don't use Jade, and honestly never really did.

### indent-guides

URL: https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides.git

Reason I no longer use: I wasn't a big fan of the visual and wound up almost never using it anyways.

### vim-css-color

URL: https://github.com/skammer/vim-css-color.git

Reason I no longer use: It was seriously adding like 3.5 seconds to start time just opening a file
